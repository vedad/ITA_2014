## Summer project at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics
This repository contains supplementary work on the lectures notes used in AST2210 -
Observational Astronomy at the University of Oslo. These notes are originally authored
by Professor Viggo Hansteen.


### Overview of project goals
The primary goals are to:
* Merge all chapters in a single document and add a table of contents. Change document
	format to `book`.
* Correct typos. Rewrite unclear paragraphs. Add relevant paragraphs and remove superflous ones.
* Create and add descriptive figures for most of the chapters.


The secondary goals below will be carried out if there's time left.
* Create and add exercises and solutions to the lecture notes, or make it separate from
	the notes.


Any new goals will be added here.


### Overview of branches
* `master` only contains the README. The final result will be merged to this branch in the
	end.
* `development` contains all modifications done to the lecture notes.
* `original` contains the original lecture notes.


Descriptions for any new branches will follow here.
